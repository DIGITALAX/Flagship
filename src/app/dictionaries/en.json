Use AI-driven content to push the narrative. Watch for organic lift points—engagement spikes, remix traction, unexpected distribution routes. Scale production only where feedback justifies it. Repeat.\n\nNobody needs to ‘find a fab shop’ first anymore. The factory is the last step, not the first. And if you do it right, by the time you need one, it’ll already be working for you.",
